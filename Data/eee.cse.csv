Thowhidur Rahman,1575071668,"We are looking for 3 talented People who will NOT develop a website like the attached image ;) Rather be creative and develop WOW websites for our clients.

Salary: 20000 - 32000 BDT (Depending on your skill and experience)
Preferred Joining Date: January 1, 2020 (If you are free, you can even join from next month)

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
It’s Simple. We will give you PSD and you have to convert them into WordPress. Your conversion should be W3C Compliant, Pixel Perfect, Responsive, Easily Editable Backend, Browser Compatible and most importantly, your code should be WordPress Standard. Apart from the knowledge of WordPress, these are the things we require also:
Proper knowledge of PHP, JS, JQuery & Ajax (HTML-CSS Obviously :p )
Strong knowledge on Advanced Custom Fields Pro, Redux/Codestar Framework, WooCommerce & WP Bakery Page Builder.

Few more things to note here:
We don’t expect that you will be an 100% expert of PHP, JS, JQuery & Ajax but you need to have enough knowledge to add any function our client requires on their PSD. You can take help from Google, Stack Overflow, WP Codex, we don’t care as long as you are a quick learner.
If you have knowledge of PSD to Shopify or other CMS, it will be counted as PLUS.
The PSD files will be for our Client’s websites, not for Themeforest based projects.

WHO ARE WE?
We are Psdtowpservice.com (a concern of A-WEB), one of the top ranked websites on Google providing ""PSD to WordPress"" service. (Just go to Google and search ""PSD to WordPress"", I am sure you will find us on Top 5 ;) )

WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN OUR TEAM?
Well, we are Good People ;) Here are few of our qualities:
We provide Timely Salary
You can take as much Tea-Coffee you like, Eat as much ‘Biscuits’ you want.
Air Conditioned Workstation

Year End Bonus for the Best Performer
Yearly Increment
1 Plate Kacci Biriyani Offer after completion of each SPECIAL Projects
Sometimes, You may even get a Bhel Puri or Muri Vorta in your table in the evening

WHY YOU SHOULD NOT JOIN OUR TEAM?
Here are our negative sides (we are trying to improve, trust me):
We don’t provide lunch. We have a vendor but you have to pay for it.
Our office is small. We are only 5-6 person at the moment.
Our office is situated in an Apartment. So, if you are looking for an official Space, you will be disappointed. We did few decorations though ;)

HOW TO APPLY?
Please Email us at career@a-web.org . On your email, you have to follow the below rules:

Your subject line should be “I am a PWE”
On Email Body, Write down about 2-3 of your BEST PSD to WordPress project.

Your expected Salary
Your CV (Not Mandatory, but if you can send, it would be better)
If you have experience with PSD to Shopify or other CMS, you can mention about that also.

[PLEASE READ THE ABOVE 5 POINTS AGAIN, YOUR APPLICATION WON’T BE ACCEPTED IF YOU DON’T FOLLOW THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS]

FEW REQUEST:
Please please please apply as per the instructions, don’t send only CV. If you can’t follow a job instruction, how can you follow our client’s instruction, simple :)
This is not a remote job. So, please don’t request.
Please Do not inbox if it’s not really necessary. If you inbox for No reason, we will not count your application.
If you think the salary should be more depending on the requirement, you can surely ignore this post. As we are small company, we simply can't afford more than this. I hope you can understand :)

Md.Sheikh Farid Milon,1573062100,"Escenic is looking for talents in multiple positions.
In my 7.5 years of job experience in five different companies I have found Escenic as the best workplace so far. This is a Norwegian based software company. As my previous experience, Norwegian based companies are really open minded and flat architectured. However, I have found Escenic as an exceptional one.
All of the post requires at least 3+ years job experience in related field. But in my opinion applicant having more than 12 years experience can find this position suitable. But I want to mention that this position is more technical than managerial. People who are accustomed to micromanage other employees and don't feel comfortable in a flat hierarchy might face difficulties to cope up with this company culture.
Escenic offer
- Absolutely zero micromanagement and a super flat hierarchy
- Extreme work life balance
- Transport facilities or transport allowance
- Provident fund, Insurance and other job facilities
- Market standard salary (but not in highest paying company list)
- Extreme friendly company culture (you will never feel that you are being managed by others)
- Super flexible top management (I have never seen this type of mentality even not in other european companies)
- Breakfast, Lunch and other food in dining
- Awesome performance reviewing process (I liked it)
If you don't have related experience but if you are confident in problem solving, personally I think you can apply, because we will consider your overall package not just individual checklist.

১। অনেকেই স্যালারি কম নিয়ে আমাকে ধুয়ে ফেলতেসেন। 10k আমার মতেও অনেক কম হয়ে যায়, রেঞ্জটা অফিস থেকে দেয়া। আমি এখানে কিছু করতে পারতেসিনা, ভালো না লাগলে ইগ্নোর করেন। তবে তিন মাস পরে কনফার্ম করতে পারলে স্যালারি নুন্যতম ~30k হবে আশাকরি, এতটুকু রিকমেন্ডেশন আমি অফিসকে করা যাবে।এই অফিসে আগে ইন্টার্নশিপের প্রথা ছিলনা, কোম্পানিকে অনেক রিকুয়েস্ট করে ইন্টার্নশিপের ব্যাবস্থা করা হয়েছে যাতে নতুনরা একটু সুযোগ পায়। এখন এইটাই আমাদের বিশাল অপরাধ হয়ে গেছে দেখতেছি।

২। অনেকেই বলতেছেন কোড সাবমিট করছেন, কি ভুল হইছে। আপনি নিজেই requirements গুলা ভালভাবে পড়ে আরেকবার মিলান। ভুলগুলো ঠিক করে আবার রিসাবমিট করেন। আপনি কোয়ালিফাইড না হলে এক-দেড় মাস পড়েই আবার আপনাকে বাদ দিয়ে দিবে, তখন আবার একটা ভুল বুঝাবুঝির সৃষ্টি হবে।

৩। অনেকেই বলতেছেন requirements অনেক কঠিন হয়ে গেছে। একেবারেই ডেভেলপমেন্ট জানেননা এমন কাউকে আমরা নিতে পারব না, দুঃখিত। ভালো না লাগলে ইগ্নোর করেন।

- খুব ভালো করে টাস্কের রিকোয়ারমেন্ট গুলা পড়েন, ক্লিয়ার না হলে আবার পড়েন। যেটা করতে বলা হয়েছে শুধু সেটাই করেন। অপ্রয়োজনীয় জিনিসপত্র সংযুক্ত করবেন না।

Jalal Uddin,1568741720,"Some special features of IT Firm/IT related companies in Bangladesh which you may not find in any other countries:
No follow-up after interview - so far I have found 2 companies - ""Welldev"" and ""Rokomari"" who give a mail to the candidates whom they don't select after interview. 99% companies don't care to do that.
Don't have any properly planned screening process - recently I have been called for interview in a well-known IT Firm who are in the business since 2005. 4 viva, 1 practical test and 1 written test were taken in one day. I had to answer almost similar questions in all 4 vivas. Since it is a technical job, I think they should take a practical test first. After evaluating my test they should understand if I have enough technical skills for the job and call me for an interview if they find my skills are suitable.
Don't have a pre-determined timeline period for screening processes - I was called for giving Technical exam in one of the reputed Telecommunication Companies. After the exam, they took almost 2 months to call for interview. I mean, who would expect to be called for interview after two months? Usually I wait for 1-2 weeks for a call. After that I forget about them. (It has been another two months after interview. And I never heard from them since. I presume they have chosen someone else)
Don't share salary and other benefits - I think they are afraid of or ashamed of sharing information about their budget for salary and other benefits for the employees. Back to the IT company where I have given 4 vivas, 1 written and 1 practical test. After all tests, they told me my salary expectation is higher than their budget. They didn't tell me how much they were planning to offer and even they didn't mention their salary range in the job circular they posted. If the companies would mention salary range in the job post then many job-seekers wouldn't apply for the job if the salary doesn't suit for them and thus time would have been saved for both sides. Their expectations are Sky High but when it comes to offer salary and benefits, they seem to be the most miserable company in the world.
